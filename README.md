    1- create an excel file from ICKala
    2- update that excel file to get quantity

whether he wants the to create a file or update the existing file
the user also can update a small part of the excel file

if user wants to ceate an excel file then the ickala is opened and
the main menue in the left side of site is starts getting inspected 
to find the product in each category and sub category

at last the name of the products, their categories (the last child in the hiararchy of categories),
their links are saved with the initial quantity of -1

note: main categories are also saved but without links 

when you update that file only the product with the quantity of -1 is updated
so the first time, the quantity of all the products (if this is the range you wish) get updated
but the other times only only the product with the quantity of -1 is updated
